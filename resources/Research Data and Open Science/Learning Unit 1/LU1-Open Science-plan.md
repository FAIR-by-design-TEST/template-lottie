## Introduction to Open Science
### Definitions of Open Science

#### UNESCO

Many definitions of Open Science are available, but perhaps the most comprehensive is the one provided in the [UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science (2021)](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949).
*<center><font color="#595959">“Open  science  is  defined  as  an inclusive construct that combines various movements and practices aiming to  make  multilingual  scientific  knowledge  openly  available,  accessible  and reusable  for  everyone,  to increase  scientific collaborations  and  sharing  of information for the benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community. It comprises all scientific disciplines  and  aspects  of  scholarly  practices,  including  basic  and applied sciences, natural and social sciences and the humanities, and it builds on the following key pillars: open scientific knowledge, open science infrastructures, science  communication,  open engagement  of  societal  actors  and  open dialogue with other knowledge systems.”</font></center>*
According to the UNESCO definition, open science is based on four pillars:
- Open scientific knowledge
- Open Infrastructures
- Open Scientific communication and engagement of social actors
- Open dialogue with other systems of science
