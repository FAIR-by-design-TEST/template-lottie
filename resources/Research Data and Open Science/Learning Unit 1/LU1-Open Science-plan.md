# What is Open Science?

<p align="justify">The aim of this lesson on Open Science is to provide participants with an introduction to the concepts, practices and values lying behind the term 'Open Science'. </p>

**Learning objectives**
<p align="justify">This lesson will provide answers to the following questions:</p>
- What is Open science? (main concepts, principles, key actors)
- What are the key benefits and challenges of open science
- What are the implications of reforming the way research is evaluated?

## Introduction to Open Science
### Definitions of Open Science

#### UNESCO

Many definitions of Open Science are available, but perhaps the most comprehensive is the one provided in the [UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science (2021)](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949).
*<center><font color="#595959">“Open  science  is  defined  as  an inclusive construct that combines various movements and practices aiming to  make  multilingual  scientific  knowledge  openly  available,  accessible  and reusable  for  everyone,  to increase  scientific collaborations  and  sharing  of information for the benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community. 
It comprises all scientific disciplines  and  aspects  of  scholarly  practices,  including  basic  and applied sciences, natural and social sciences and the humanities, and it builds on the following key pillars: open scientific knowledge, open science infrastructures, science  communication,  open engagement  of  societal  actors  and  open dialogue with other knowledge systems.”</font></center>*
Following the UNESCO definition, Open Science has the potential to improve all phases of the scientific process and builds on four key pillars:
- Open scientific knowledge
- Open science infrastructures
- Open engagement of societal actors 
- Open dialogue with other knowledge systems

The graph below is taken from the [UNESCO brochure on Open Science](https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/open_science_brochure_en.pdf) and represents the components of Open Science. As illustrated, Open Science encompasses all scientific disciplines and practices.

#### Schools of thought

Another attempt at defining the umbrella term Open Science comes from [Benedikt Fecher and Sascha Friesike (2013)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2#Tab1) who propose five Open Science schools of thought.

1. **The Democratic School** aims to make both the final results of research and research data available to everyone.
2. **The Pragmatic School** endeavours to make research more efficient by opening up all phases of the scientific process and promoting collaboration, including through the use of online tools.
3. **The Infrastructure School** focuses on openly available technological infrastructures needed to conduct science.
5. **The Public School** aims to make research accessible, participatory, and understandable to everyone, including citizens.
6. **The Measurement School** seeks alternative measures to evaluate research.

#### FOSTER Taxonomy

The last representation provided here to explore the various facets of what Open Science entails is a taxonomy which was published in the European project [FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/).

The taxonomy shows Open Science components as follows: 

1. **Open Access**: Open access to research publications, meaning making research results easily accessible and consultable.
2. **Open Data and FAIR Data**: This category involves the sharing of open data and adherence to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
3. **Tools**: This includes resources and technologies used to support researchers in the practice of Open Science.
4. **Policies**: Institutional and national policies that promote and regulate the practice of Open Science.
5. **Infrastructures**: This pillar pertains to the technical and organizational environment that facilitates sharing and collaboration in open research.
6. **Assessment**: How to measure and evaluate adherence to Open Science principles.
