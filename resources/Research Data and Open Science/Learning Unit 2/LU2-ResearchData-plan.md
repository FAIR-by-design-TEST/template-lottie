# Research Data Lesson plan 

## Research Data, why should we care?
- The aim of this unit is to show participants how research data management is a way to shape integrity and reproducibility of scientific research. A number of concepts are highlighted: such as the research lifecycle, open data and FAIR data.
	- (SSH) Research data and Research Data Management definition 
	- Research Data lifecycle
	- Values: integrity and reproducibility
	- Open Data / FAIR Data
	- Obligations from funding bodies / EC policy
	- Open Access
	- Examples of open data / public bodies

### Location
- is it going to be online or physical
- if physical any special room type should be noted (e.g. classroom, IT lab, ...)

### Total duration

### Number of attendees
- important to know the max group size
- can be a number range (e.g. 20-30)

### Learning objectives
After this unit:
- You will be able to indicate what information is considered research data;
- You will be able to explain that the meaning of this research data varies per target group and per phase of the research lifecycle;
- You will understand how open science, data management and FAIR data shape the integrity and reproducibility of scientific research;
- You will have a global overview of the various types of data supporters;
- You will have a broad overview ofÂ  a number of information sources that can further help you to get up-to-date in data management support.

### Plan
| Duration | Topic                  | Key points/Teaching Method/Questions                                   | Activities               | Resources                  |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| X mins   | Welcome / Introduction | - housekeeping  - introduce trainer and trainees - learning objectives | ice breaker              | e.g. name tags, flip chart |
| X mins   | The hook               | - focus attention - provide framework                                  | brainstorm expectations  | e.g. post-it notes         |
| X mins   | Training               | information + examples                                                 | check for understanding  | e.g. pptx + handouts       |
| X mins   | Guided practice        | trainer acts as facilitator                                            | exercise or activity     | e.g. posters and markers   |
| X mins   | Summary                | key takeaways                                                          | reinforcement assignment | e.g. cards                 |

Note: If the <font color="#92d050">training is relying heavily on presentations then another option for the plan layout is to provided in a slide by slide using slide thumbnails in the topic column. In this case each row in the table should refer to a separate slide in the presentation.</font>
