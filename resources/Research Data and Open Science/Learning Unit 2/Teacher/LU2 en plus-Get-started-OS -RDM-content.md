[ List of activities]

#### **Research communities (international and national)**

Individual research disciplines may already have put together materials and have advice on how to implement Open Science in their discipline. For example [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/) is a educational and information resource on data and metadata standards [9].  The [Research Data Alliance](https://rd-alliance.org/) have a variety of different [interest and working groups](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups) in data sharing in specific disciplines. Scientific Societies and Publishers can also provide advice [10] [11].

#### **Open Science related communities**

There are a number of communities that are focussed on Open Science activities. [ReproducibiliTea](https://reproducibilitea.org/) is a grass-roots journal club initiative that is based in over 100 institutions and is a forum to discuss reproducibility, closely allied to Open Science [12]. The [FAIRdata forum](https://fairdataforum.org/) allows you to browse materials and raise questions that are related to FAIR [13]. Correspondingly the [PID forum](https://pidforum.org/) allows you to ask questions on PIDs in general [14]. A list of Open Science communities is provided in the next module (Open Tools).
