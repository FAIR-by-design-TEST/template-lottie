# Get Started with OS and RDM 

## Get your data ready for sharing 
- The aim of this unit is to enable participants to put in practice what they have learnt on OS and RDM in LU1 and LU2. This unit focuses on methodologies, tools and examples to support researchers in their data management practices.
	- Recall benefits of RDM (optimise research outputs, increase research impact, support open scientific enquiry)
	- Where to find support (research communities)
	- How to publish Open Data: activities to disseminate research data in open format, from production to online display 
		- Repositories for SSH
		- How to find a trusted repository
		- How to use Zenodo
	- How to publish OA: ORE, OA journals, commercial publisher but maintain rights. (show S-Légami from APRE)
	- Open Science workflows
### Location
- is it going to be online or physical
- if physical any special room type should be noted (e.g. classroom, IT lab, ...)

### Total duration

### Number of attendees
- important to know the max group size
- can be a number range (e.g. 20-30)

### Learning objectives
This unit will answer the following questions
- What is Open Access to scientific knowledge? 
- What are the trends in open science policy in Europe?
- How can I make my research more open?
- What are open science workflows?
- Why and how to use a trusted repository?

<font color="#92d050">- learning objectives should be devised using the verbs from the Bloom's Taxonomy</font>
<font color="#92d050">- learning objectives should be SMART</font>

### Plan
| Duration | Topic                  | Key points/Teaching Method/Questions                                   | Activities               | Resources                  |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| X mins   | Welcome / Introduction | - housekeeping  - introduce trainer and trainees - learning objectives | ice breaker              | e.g. name tags, flip chart |
| X mins   | The hook               | - focus attention - provide framework                                  | brainstorm expectations  | e.g. post-it notes         |
| X mins   | Training               | information + examples                                                 | check for understanding  | e.g. pptx + handouts       |
| X mins   | Guided practice        | trainer acts as facilitator                                            | exercise or activity     | e.g. posters and markers   |
| X mins   | Summary                | key takeaways                                                          | reinforcement assignment | e.g. cards                 |

Note: If the <font color="#92d050">training is relying heavily on presentations then another option for the plan layout is to provided in a slide by slide using slide thumbnails in the topic column. In this case each row in the table should refer to a separate slide in the presentation.</font>


### Assessment

- Formative and summative
- results shown during the course in real time
### Certificate or Badge
- no certificate or badge is issued 

### Reflection
- how did it go
- highlights: what went great
- improvement points: what went wrong
