# Get Started with OS and RDM 

## Get your data ready for sharing 
- The aim of this unit is to enable participants to put in practice what they have learnt on OS and RDM in LU1 and LU2. This unit focuses on methodologies, tools and examples to support researchers in their data management practices.
	- Recall benefits of RDM (optimise research outputs, increase research impact, support open scientific enquiry)
	- How to publish Open Data: activities to disseminate research data in open format, from production to online display 
		- Repositories for SSH
		- How to find a trusted repository
		- How to use Zenodo
	- How to publish OA: ORE, OA journals, commercial publisher but maintain rights. (show S-Légami from APRE)
	- Open Science workflows
### Location
- is it going to be online or physical
- if physical any special room type should be noted (e.g. classroom, IT lab, ...)

### Total duration

### Number of attendees
- important to know the max group size
- can be a number range (e.g. 20-30)

### Learning objectives
After this unit:
- You will be able to indicate what information is considered research data;
- You will be able to explain that the meaning of this research data varies per target group and per phase of the research lifecycle;
- You will understand how open science, data management and FAIR data shape the integrity and reproducibility of scientific research;
- You will have a global overview of the various types of data supporters;
- You will have a broad overview of  a number of information sources that can further help you to get up-to-date in data management support.

### Plan
| Duration | Topic                  | Key points/Teaching Method/Questions                                   | Activities               | Resources                  |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| X mins   | Welcome / Introduction | - housekeeping  - introduce trainer and trainees - learning objectives | ice breaker              | e.g. name tags, flip chart |
| X mins   | The hook               | - focus attention - provide framework                                  | brainstorm expectations  | e.g. post-it notes         |
| X mins   | Training               | information + examples                                                 | check for understanding  | e.g. pptx + handouts       |
| X mins   | Guided practice        | trainer acts as facilitator                                            | exercise or activity     | e.g. posters and markers   |
| X mins   | Summary                | key takeaways                                                          | reinforcement assignment | e.g. cards                 |

Note: If the <font color="#92d050">training is relying heavily on presentations then another option for the plan layout is to provided in a slide by slide using slide thumbnails in the topic column. In this case each row in the table should refer to a separate slide in the presentation.</font>


### Assessment

- Formative and summative
- results shown during the course in real time
### Certificate or Badge
- no certificate or badge is issued 

### Reflection
- how did it go
- highlights: what went great
- improvement points: what went wrong
